# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: php work api

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run work
        env:
         AAA: ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
          echo $AAA
          ls *.tar.gz>ls.log
          for i in $(cat ls.log)   # 这里可以使用Linux命令cat
          do
             tar -zxf $i & > /dev/null   #  & > /dev/null语句的意思是让输出的东西不要显示出来
          done
